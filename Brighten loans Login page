In practice, it’s very rare for payday loan debt to be written off. This is because payday lenders make significant sums from the interest that they charge on these loans.

This means that you should try and pay off payday loans as soon as you possibly can. If you can’t pay back a payday loan, the account may be sent to a collection agency, which will pursue you for the money and interest that you owe. This is not only unpleasant but also can add money to your overall debt—and it will damage your credit.
